# History
Contains all of my history files
# To edit
Just fork (like ya do).
If you don't know Latex, you can find a lot of resources online. I use a template, so if you want to edit the content,
skip to the line that says "\begin{document}". 
I use Sublime text editor for all of my programming in Latex.
# To compile your files
I use a program called MikTex. You can download it here: https://miktex.org/download
It will convert your Latex code to a pdf
