	\begin{itemize}
		\item Republicans unanimously nominated Richard Nixon due to his diplomatic travels and his debate with 
			Nikita Krushchev(aka the kitchen debate).
		\item Many democrats believed that they had a chance at the nomination, but were over taken by the 43-year-old senator from 
			Massachusetts, Kennedy.
		\item The election was the first election to have televised debates.
		\item This gave Kennedy the advantage since he looked more calm and comfortable on camera.
