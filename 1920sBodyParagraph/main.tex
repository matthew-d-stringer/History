    In the 1920s, the government did little in order to protect African-Americans.
% 
    First, progressive reforms made before the outbreak of the war did not affect 
    African-Americans. 
% Insert sentence analysing the evidence
% 
    Second, African-Americans were robbed of the right to vote.
    Without this, African-Americans were not able to participate in democracy and 
    create change that improved their living condition, and protected them from racist
    laws and leaders.
% 
    Third, African-Americans were offered little education from the government.
    This lack of education caused the public to view African-Americans as unintelligent 
    and their rights were not taken seriously.
% 
    The lack of government protection lead to the hatred of African-Americans and 
    the continuation of traditional oppression.
